### National Winner â€” Smart India Hackathon 2023  
**December 2023**  

Winner in the **Student Innovation for Transport and Logistics** category.

We developed a multi-component AI-powered traffic mitigation system combining computer vision, adaptive algorithms, smart parking, and drone-based logistics.

---

### Key Features:

- **Adaptive Traffic Light Control:**  
  - Custom algorithm for dynamic traffic light timing.  
  - Traffic flow optimized using real-time car count per lane.

- **Computer Vision-Based Traffic Monitoring:**  
  - YOLO model to count vehicles at junctions.  
  - Detection of traffic rule violations (lane misuse, seatbelt detection).

- **Smart Parking System:**  
  - Works with both formal and informal (kaccha) parking lots.  
  - Uses top-view cameras with marked spots and car counting algorithms.

- **Drone-Based Delivery System:**  
  - Conceptualized optimized drone delivery routes.  
  - Path optimization via 3D simulation environments.

### System Workflow:

- **Step 1:** Real-time traffic footage captured and processed using YOLO.  
- **Step 2:** Adaptive control algorithm adjusts signal timings.  
- **Step 3:** Traffic violations flagged automatically.  
- **Step 4:** Smart parking slots identified using a top-view camera.  
- **Step 5:** Drone paths optimized using simulation models.
